# NameBadgeV1

This code is for displaying custom text through an Adafruit [Quad Alphanumeric Display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2158) via a Trinket M0 (other Arduino boards are available).

Button support has been added to allow for multiple displays to be available.

Simply open the .ino file and upload to your board of choice. Change the text for 'writeName' to your own (upper or lower case are accepted) and change the variable **buttonPin** to where your button is connected, if no button leave the pin how it is the code will just display the initial text.
